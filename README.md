# Grolsch

Grolsch is an authentic and refreshing beer brand, delivering a fresh,
natural experience with a particular flavor.

Grolsch 0% alcohol-free is a robust beer, with minty tones and a slight sweetness. The result is a beer that makes it the perfect thirst
quencher at every moment of the day.

Mint is present as the main ingredient, giving a feeling of coolness to your mouth, leaving a fresh and healthy breath. That is why 4 out
of 5 brewers and dentists recommends it.

Grolsch, a healthy and fresh tradition to share with friends.

Be cool. Be fresh. Be blue.
